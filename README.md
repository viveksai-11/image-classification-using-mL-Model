# **Implementation of Machine Learning Model for Image Classification**

**Overview:**

The **Implementation of ML Model for Image Classification** is an interactive web application built using **Streamlit** that integrates two powerful image classification models: **MobileNetV2** (pretrained on ImageNet) and a custom **CIFAR-10 model**. This app allows users to upload images, classify them using either model, and view prediction results along with confidence scores. 

Whether you're a beginner learning about image classification or someone interested in practical machine learning applications, this tool serves as both an educational resource and a hands-on application for real-time image classification.

## **Key Features**

- **Dual Model Support**:
  - **MobileNetV2 (ImageNet)**: A lightweight, fast model that can recognize 1,000 different classes such as animals, objects, and vehicles from the vast ImageNet dataset.
  - **Custom CIFAR-10 Model**: A model trained to classify images into 10 specific categories, including airplanes, automobiles, birds, and more, from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

- **Intuitive User Interface**:
  - **Easy Navigation**: A sleek sidebar allows users to seamlessly switch between the MobileNetV2 and CIFAR-10 models for image classification.
  - **Real-Time Image Classification**: Upload any image and get predictions immediately with associated confidence scores for a more transparent and reliable classification process.

- **Educational and Practical Use**:
  - Ideal for learning about the implementation and performance of deep learning models.
  - Practical for anyone working in fields where image classification is necessary, such as AI, computer vision, and data science.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.7 or later
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

### **Installation Guide**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   First, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JayRathod341997/DeepLensX.git
   cd Implementation-of-ML-model-for-image-classification
   ```

2. **Set up a Virtual Environment**:
   Create and activate a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the Required Dependencies**:
   Install the necessary packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit Application**:
   Start the Streamlit app by running the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Access the App**:
   Once the app is running, it should automatically open in your default web browser. If it doesnâ€™t, you can manually open the app by navigating to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8501
   ```

## **How to Use**

1. **Upload Image**: Click the upload button and select an image from your local device.
2. **Select a Model**: Use the sidebar to choose between the **MobileNetV2** model (for general image classification) and the **CIFAR-10** model (for more specialized categories).
3. **Get Predictions**: After uploading the image, the app will classify the image and display the predicted class along with a confidence score.
